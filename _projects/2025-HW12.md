Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a bar of a fixed length (your
choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear
actuator (pick from this online catalog, use max force values only), design a
frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height.
Assume all the support and actuator are rigid.

Constraints:
Mechanism must fit entirely within a 150 cm × 50 cm design space
Bar length is fixed at L = ___ cm
Exactly three pin supports, with two mounted to the ground
Linear actuator force limited to its maximum rated force
All joints are ideal frictionless pins
Planar (2D) motion only

Objectives:
Maximize the lifted weight
Maximize the vertical lift height
Maintain a simple, physically realizable design

Design Degrees of Freedom:
The mechanism has a single degree of freedom defined by the rotation of the bar about a ground-mounted pin. Motion is controlled by the extension and retraction of a linear actuator, which connects the bar to a second ground pin. The geometry of the actuator attachment point along the bar and the location of the ground pin define the mechanical advantage of the system and are primary design variables.
