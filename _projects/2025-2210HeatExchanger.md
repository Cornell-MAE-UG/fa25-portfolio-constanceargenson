title: ENGRD 2210 – Thermodynamics Portfolio
description: This project analyzes the operation and performance of a small-scale liquid–liquid heat exchanger under different flow configurations. Using experimental data collected from a hands-on laboratory setup, I applied mass, energy, and entropy balances to model system behavior and evaluate how design and operating conditions influence thermal performance.
technologies: Heat Exchangers

Device: Heat Exchanger
Equipment:
    Plate heat exchanger
    Two water pumps
    Four water reservoirs (hot source, cold source, outlets)
    Immersion heater
    Ice bath
    Thermocouples and thermometers
    Food dye (flow visualization)
Configuration:
    Hot and cold water are circulated through opposite sides of the heat exchanger. System operated in counterflow and parallel flow. Reservoir temperatures monitored over time. Flow directions visualized using dye

Governing Equations: 
    Mass Balance (Steady State)
    Energy Balance
    Entropy Balance

Experimental Results: 
    Counterflow configuration produced greater temperature change in both streams
    Parallel flow showed rapid temperature equilibration near the inlet
    Steady state was approached but not perfectly achieved due to:
    Heat loss to surroundings
    Reservoir temperature drift

Proposed Design Improvement: Added Insulation
    A proposed improvement is to insulate the heat exchanger body and exposed tubing using foam or fiberglass.
    Expected impact:
    Reduces external heat loss
    Moves system closer to adiabatic operation
    Increases heat transfer effectiveness
    Reduces entropy generation
